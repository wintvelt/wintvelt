- 👋 Hi, I’m @wintvelt
- 🚀 Consultant for B2B on positioning and GTM by day, coder by night
- ＜／＞ Javascript, Node, AWS, Serverless, React, NextJS and big fan of Elm and its community (but have been out of touch for a long time)

- 🏛️ Long history in coding, since the days of TRS-80, long before internet. Assembler, Basic, Cobol, Pascal
- 🎖️ Biggest thing I shipped was still a hobby-project: Native React app (Expo) to share photos of events between just friends
- 🌱 Currently building AI skills (for AI and for myself) around research, intrigued by Openclaw, Claude cowork. Curious where this is heading. Hope to find time to dive deeper into Claude code
